node-addon-example
==================

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example)

Sample application of a Node C++ addon packaged with [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp).

If you are interested in learning how to write C++ addons see the [official guide](http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html#addons_hello_world).

This repo is intended as starter code for your own C++ module - feel free to copy and modify. The docs below are meant to be a template for how you might document your module once packaged with `node-pre-gyp`.
